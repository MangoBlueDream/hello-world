# hello-world
My first repo. Hello World!

My name is JJ Meyer. I am a South African and enjoy learning new things. I love a challenge and a new venture, and that is what programming is for me. 
I appreciate it's application and also wish to master a few languages along the way. I have been studying Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, a bit of Java and wish to be more proficient with it. I want to build things that will help improve the world we live in. I wish to create revolutionary programs that will improve our knowledge of the world around us and help raise the human race to a better standard of being.
